#Search

# 1.	Functionality
The website is to take the user input and return a list of games in according to the relevancy of the input. Information returned would include the title, release date, metacritic score, price, and description.
To save space and reduce load time several unused data columns in the dataset were left out. Data such as the publisher count, achievement count, and linux requirement.
# 2.	Algorithm
The search function will use TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency) by taking in every word on the input and calculates the frequency of the term among the documents then multiplied by the inverted frequency of term occurrences in each document. This repeats for every word and return a score to be outputted in the results page.

#Classifier

# 1.	Functionality  
After the user enters the query, the program would run MNB by running NB for every individual tag (Action, Adventure, Strategy, RPG, Sport, Racing). Returning to the user would be the total amount of words for each tag, probability of every tag, number of unique words overall in the dataset, probability of every query word given every tag, and the final probability of every tag given the query.  
# 2.	Algorithm  
Multinomial Naive Bayes by finding the best tag through P(tag | query) = P(tag)*P(word_1 | tag)*...*P(ward_n | tag)  

#Recommender

# 1.	Functionality  
Takes up to the past 3 search queries from the user and displays the top 10 recommended games.
# 2.	Algorithm  
A context based algorithm that applies the TF-IDF algorithm coupled with Multinomial Naive Bayes [P(tag | query) = P(tag)*P(word_1 | tag)*...*P(ward_n | tag)] by computing the TF-IDF score for each game per query multiply by a weight calculated by the Multinomial Naive Bayes then sort the score desending.
